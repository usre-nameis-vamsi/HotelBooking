How It Works
## 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
Replace your-username/your-repo-name with the actual GitHub repository URL.

## 2️⃣ Install Dependencies (Handle Legacy Peer Deps)
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
If you get peer dependency errors, use the --legacy-peer-deps flag, shown in above

This ensures older packages that don’t match the latest peer requirements will still install properly.

## 3️⃣ Run the Development Server
     npm run dev or yarn dev
This starts your local dev server (usually at http://localhost:3000).

## 4️⃣ Explore the App
    http://localhost:3000
Once the dev server starts, open your browser and go to the above URL.

## 5️⃣ Build for Production
    npm run build
    npm start
If you want to create an optimized build, use above commands.
